# codamSimonApi

Simulate working environment for an IT student.

It will cover doing roughly the following:

- Developing a web-based API for simple (ReST-like) CRUD operations using Kotlin/JVM
- Scrum rituals/meetings: daily, refinement, estimation, planning, retrospective
- Create pull requests and let it be reviewed + review another person's pull request (comments)
- Being able to run it locally and via docker (optionally hosted somewhere with continuous deployment)
- Continuous integration via GitHub actions
- Fully automated tested with high coverage unit tests and higher level tests
- Using modern libraries, architectures and design decisions
